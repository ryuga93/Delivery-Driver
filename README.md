 A simple Car Delivery game. The goal is to pick up a parcel and drop it at the designated location. 
 
 Your are able to drive around the map to pick up the parcels. The car will change color when it has the parcel picked up, and will return to the normal     color when the parcel has been delivered. The car will slow down when collide with environment objects such as trees and houses, and speed up when driving over a speed boost point.
